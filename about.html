<p><img src="{{ site.url }}/img/sophie.jpg"  class="img-responsive img-thumbnail" alt="Sophie Engle" width="400"></a></p>

<p>I am an Assistant Professor in the <a href="http://cs.usfca.edu/">Department of Computer Science</a> at the <a href="http://www.usfca.edu/">University of San Francisco</a>. I am also the Graduate Director for the <a href="http://www.usfca.edu/artsci/csg/">Masters in Science in Computer Science (MSCS)</a> program, and teach courses for the <a href="https://www.usfca.edu/artsci/analytics/">Masters in Science in Analytics (MSAN)</a> program.</p>

<p>I graduated with my Ph.D. in <a href="http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/">Computer Science</a> from the <a href="http://www.ucdavis.edu/">University of California, Davis</a> under the guidance of <a href="http://nob.cs.ucdavis.edu/~bishop/">Matt Bishop</a>, <a href="http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/~peisert/">Sean Peisert</a>, and many others at the <a href="http://seclab.cs.ucdavis.edu/">SecLab</a>. I received my B.S. in <a href="http://www.cs.unomaha.edu/">Computer Science</a> from the <a href="http://www.unomaha.edu/">University of Nebraska at Omaha</a>, studying networking and computer security with <a href="http://nucia.ist.unomaha.edu/?p=nuciafaculty&f=11">Ken Dick</a> and <a href="http://nucia.unomaha.edu/index.php?p=nuciafaculty&f=71">Blaine Burnham</a> at the <a href="http://pki.nebraska.edu/">Peter Kiewit Institute</a>. I also frequently collaborate with my significant other, <a href="http://node99.org/">Sean Whalen</a>.</p>

<p>I have many research interests, including data visualization, computer security, and computer science education. Please see my <a href="{{ site.url }}/cv.html">curriculum vitae</a> for more information.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p><img src="{{ site.url }}/img/davis.jpg" width="400" class="img-responsive img-thumbnail" alt="Davis, California"></p>

<p>I grew up in Omaha, Nebraska. While I love the west coast, I still miss the green rolling hills of corn, gorgeous skies and sunsets, dramatic storms, open spaces, <a href="http://www.omahazoo.com/">amazing zoo</a>, and four seasons. I moved to Davis, California (pictured above) in 2002 to work on my graduate degree. I loved the <a href="http://daviswiki.org/Davis_Farmers_Market">Davis Farmer's Market</a>, walking down <a href="http://daviswiki.org/Olive_Tree_Lane">Olive Tree Lane</a>, and exploring the <a href="http://daviswiki.org/Village_Homes">Village Homes</a> neighborhood (where the street names come from Tolkien books).</p>

<p>In 2010, I moved to San Francisco near Ocean Beach (pictured above) and love it. I enjoy walking along the dunes&mdash;even on the foggy gray days. I love the laid-back culture of the neighborhood, and the <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/trouble-coffee-company-san-francisco">coffee</a> <a href="http://www.javabeachsf.com/">in the</a> <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/beachside-coffee-bar-and-kitchen-san-francisco">area is</a> <a href="http://devilsteethbakingcompany.com/">amazing</a>.</p>

<h2>Family</h2>

<p><img src="{{ site.url }}/img/dad.jpg" width="400" class="img-responsive img-thumbnail" alt="Dea Engle"></p>

<p>I grew up in a family of five with two younger sisters, and an extended family in South Korea. While we are geographically spread out, we are all still very close.</p>

<p>I got my passion for computers and teaching from my dad (picture above). I used to tag along to his work on weekends and watch him work with huge mainframes. My own first computer was a hand-me down from his work and ran OS2. I eventually started to help him at work, which led to my first internship at PKS Information Systems in 1997.</p>

<p>Sadly, my dad passed away in 2006 right after his 50th birthday to pancreatic cancer. He was a great father and mentor, and respected by many. I miss him every day. Pancreatic cancer has only a 6% five year survival rate. If you want to help change that, I suggest you look into the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network at <a href="http://www.pancan.org/">http://www.pancan.org/</a> online.</p>

<p>I met my significant other (and frequent collaborator) Sean Whalen at the University of Nebraska at Omaha. See <a href="http://node99.org/">node99.org</a> for more information on his research interests.</p>

<h2>Casablanca</h2>

<p><img src="{{ site.url }}/img/casablanca.jpg" width="400" class="img-responsive img-thumbnail" alt="Casablanca"></p>

<p>We have a male tri-color Pembroke Welsh Corgi named Casablanca (after the movie). We got him as a puppy in 2010 from a breeder shortly after I finished my degree. Casablanca is like many corgis&mdash;extremely stubborn and vocal, yet goofy and adorable at the same time. Without him, I would never leave my computer and stop working!</p>
