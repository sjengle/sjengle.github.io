<p>I will be speaking at the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Visualisation-South-Bay/">Big Data Visualisation - South Bay</a> meetup on <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Big-Data-Visualisation-South-Bay/events/179051462/">Tuesday, May 13, 2014</a>. My talk will be:</p>

<blockquote>
<h4>How Good People Make Bad Graphs: Unintentional Fibbing with Visualization</h4>

<p>Reasonable goals can often result in incredibly misleading visualizations. This talk will show several examples illustrating how easy (and how dangerous) it is to lie with data visualization, and discuss some of the goals that may have led to that result. Then, we will explore how to rework those visualizations to still achieve those goals without distorting our perception of the data.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I will post slides here after the meetup.</p>
