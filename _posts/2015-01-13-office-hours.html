<p>My office hours for <strong>Spring 2015</strong> will be every Monday and Wednesday from 1:00pm to 2:00pm. You are always welcome to stop in anytime my door is open, or contact me to make a specific appointment.</p>

<p class="small text-muted">I will be teaching at the downtown campus starting on March 24, 2015, and will not be on main campus on Tuesdays, Thursdays, or Fridays. If you need to meet on those days, we can arrange a virtual appointment over Google Hangout.</p>
