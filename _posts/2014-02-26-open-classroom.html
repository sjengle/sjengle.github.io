<p>The <a href="http://usfcte.net/">Center of Teaching Excellence</a> <a href="http://usfcte.net/activities/openclassrooms/">open classroom</a> focus this semester is <strong>educational technology</strong>, and I am <a href="http://usfcte.net/activities/openclassrooms/hosts/#engle">one of the hosts</a> this semester. All faculty members are welcome to sign up for a visit (either to the classroom, or one-on-one with me to see the "behind the scenes" look)!</p>
